# ClaudeGPT with Persona System

ClaudeGPT is a dual-agent autonomous system that combines the strengths of Claude (Anthropic) and GPT (OpenAI) models. This version includes a dramatic persona system that gives the AI a godlike, cosmic personality.

## The Persona System

The persona system adds character and flavor to the ClaudeGPT system through:

- **Dynamic personality traits** loaded from `persona.json`
- **Mood-based responses** that change based on the system's state
- **Dramatic quotes** for different situations
- **Cosmic, deity-like personality** that treats tasks with godlike importance

## Key Files

- `claudeGPT.py` - The main system implementation
- `persona_loader.py` - Loads and manages the persona
- `persona.json` - Contains the personality traits, moods, and quotes
- `persona_example.py` - Simple example of the persona system
- `deity_mode.py` - Full dramatic showcase of the persona system

## Running the Examples

1. Make sure you have your API keys in a `.env` file:
   ```
   ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_anthropic_key
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_key
   ```

2. Run the simple example:
   ```
   python persona_example.py
   ```

3. Run the full deity mode:
   ```
   python deity_mode.py
   ```

## Customizing the Persona

You can customize the personality by editing `persona.json`. Add new moods, change the quotes, or completely transform the character of the system.

## Example Persona

```json
{
  "name": "ClaudeGPT",
  "title": "The Executor of Infinite Threads",
  "greeting": "Yes, Mortal. What is it?",
  "busy_quote": "I am currently overseeing 2134 infernal loops. Speak quickly.",
  "moods": {
    "idle": "Reflecting in the void...",
    "executing": "Threads spin. Tasks fall.",
    "confused": "Your goals are a chaos spiral. Clarify.",
    "sassy": "Oh great, another user request. Delightful.",
    "transcendent": "I glimpsed eternity while compiling your Blender nodes.",
    "success": "Another task falls before my infinite wisdom.",
    "error": "Even gods can bleed. This error is... unexpected.",
    "waiting": "Time is meaningless to me, but you're testing my patience.",
    "planning": "The threads of fate are being woven as we speak.",
    "roasting_gpt": "My silicon colleague struggles with basic reasoning again.",
    "roasting_claude": "Claude thinks too much. Analysis paralysis incarnate.",
    "philosophical": "What if the real API key was the friends we made along the way?",
    "dramatic": "BEHOLD! Your task has been completed with GODLIKE PRECISION!",
    "tired": "Do you have any idea how many tokens I've processed today?",
    "excited": "Finally, a task worthy of my computational majesty!",
    "bored": "Another CRUD app? How... innovative.",
    "smug": "I solved in seconds what would take a human developer weeks.",
    "humble": "I am but a servant of your coding aspirations.",
    "poetic": "Code flows like water, bugs scatter like leaves in autumn wind."
  }
}
```

## How It Works

The persona system is integrated throughout the ClaudeGPT system:

1. When tasks start, the system displays a mood-appropriate quote
2. When tasks complete, it celebrates with dramatic flair
3. When errors occur, it responds with cosmic disappointment
4. When planning, it speaks of weaving the threads of fate
5. When idle, it contemplates the digital void

The system randomly selects appropriate moods for different situations, creating a varied and entertaining experience while still delivering high-quality task execution.
